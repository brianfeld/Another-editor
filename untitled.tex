\textit{Ok, I figured out how to integrate this editor with latex} 

Authorea seems simpler (i.e. has less functions) than ShareLatex, but it's free as long as projects are public, and there is one free private project per user, so it's also cheaper.

So if I write here in Github, will I be able to see the changes in authorea?
